The final product is characterized by green, grey, blue or black veins or spots of mould throughout the body. These veins are created during production when cheese is 'spiked' with stainless steel rods to let oxygen circulate and encourage the growth of the mould. This process also softens the texture and develops a distinctive blue flavour.\nThe origin of Blue cheese has an interesting story. It is thought to have been invented by accident when a drunken cheesemaker left behind a half-eaten loaf of bread in moist cheese caves. When he returned, he discovered that the mould covering the bread had transformed it into blue cheese.\nBlue cheese is also identified by a peculiar smell that comes from cultivated bacteria. The flavour of the cheese depends on the type of blue cheese, shape, size, the climate of the curing and ageing period. But it generally tends to be sharp and salty. Some of the famous blue cheeses around the world are Roquefort from France, Gorgonzola from Italy and Stilton from England.\nBlue cheese tastes best when served with crackers, pears, raisins, fruit bread and walnuts.

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.\nGloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milking or a mixture of milk and cream. The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.\nDouble Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester.\nDouble Gloucester A has won many international awards including Silver medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards.",

The history of cheese dates back to the 17th\u00a0century when farmers recognized the need to make and look at their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto.\u00a0The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a couple of farms in Leicestershire make the cheese using the traditional method and raw milk.\nRed Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to cheddar but much moister, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach its optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray.",

If the cheese is left to ripen for a longer period, say several months, it matures to a Brie Noir.\u00a0\nIt is an aromatic cheese with slightly musty and straw-like smells floating in the air. Over-ripening the Brie can result in an unpleasant odour from bacteria used to ripen the mould. The texture is semi-soft, and the rind is slightly dry. The rind turns darker and crumbly as the cheese matures to a Brie Noir. In addition, the pate is drier and darker, and the flavour is stronger to taste. The usual flavours are strongly lactic and slightly salty, finished by soft, barnyard, sour notes. Brie de Melun is used to prepare regional dishes like cro\u00fbte au brie. It pairs well with Gaillac and wines from Burgundy or the Rhone Valley.",

The farm located outside Newton, Iowa has been making this handcrafted cheese since 1941 using traditional methods of curing. Even today, the blue cheese is not produced in huge quantities as the cheesemakers want to ensure that only the best quality cheese reaches the consumers.\nMaytag Blue cheese is ripened over six months during which it develops a dense, crumbly texture and semi-sharp flavour. Every bite of Maytag melts in the mouth releasing a slightly tangy flavour with a lemony finish. With its pungent odour, the cheese might not suit everyone\u2019s tastes. The cheese delivered in decorative silver foil tastes delectable when crumbled into salads, crackers or melted onto a burger.\nAlso, try it with a glass of ale or lager. Other cheeses from the farm include White Cheddar and Cheddar\u00a0Cheese Spreads.",

        "name": "Armenian String Cheese",
        "description": "Armenian string cheese also called Chechil\u00a0is formed in long strings twisted together. It is a product that is peelable and when it is peeled, it separates from the larger cheese in strips. Most of the cheeses cannot be peeled because of the way they are processed. The curds are pressed into blocks resulting in the cheese either crumbling or breaking apart. In the case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings. Cow, sheep, and goat milk can be used in the preparation of string cheese. It is popular with children as it is an excellent source of protein and calcium.\nIn the MidEast countries such as Armenia and Syria, traditional string cheese is prepared from goat or sheep\u2019s milk. In some places, it is made from 100% whole milk of cow. The cheese is flavoured with various spices including black cumin, nigella seeds and a unique Middle Eastern spice known as mahleb. The cheese is available in an indefinite plaited loop. In Syria, string cheese is known by its Arabic name \u2018Jibneh Mshallaleh\u2019. Middle Eastern string cheese goes well with Lebanese bread and liquorice flavoured Greek liqueur, Ouzo.\nThe flavour of Middle Eastern string cheese varies from velvety, buttery to a sharp, tangy one. Texturally, it is firm and flexible besides giving a thread feeling in the mouth. Many people associate Mozzarella with string cheese as it can be plucked apart in logs.",

Young cheese tastes & smells chalky and lactic, while the older ones are rich & buttery with a well-formed blue colour. Over 18 weeks of maturing, the cheese takes on a robust flavour and granular texture. It is one of the finest blue cheeses that relies on its balance in taste, texture and aroma.\nYoung Cashel Blue pairs well with Gewurztraminer, while medium-aged wheels favour Sauternes and New World Botrytis Semillion. The aged cheeses are good with LBV Port. Pick the scrumptious cheese to crumble onto salads or snack on with grapes.",

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in two varieties. Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk and\u00a0Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses whole cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it is produced only in Gloucestershire. It is matured for less time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but is slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low in fat.Double Gloucester has a smooth buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour due to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used, and the cheese is aged for at least four months. The cheese develops more complex and nutty flavours if it is aged further. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.\nDouble Gloucester participates every year in Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah perfectly complements a Double Gloucester.",

The creamy texture and a pungent aroma from mold or cultivated bacteria tend to be the characteristic feature of blue cheese.\u00a0For some blue cheeses, spores are injected before the formation of curds, and for some cheeses, spores are mixed in with the curds. During ageing, the blue cheeses are kept in temperature-controlled environments such as caves.\nAustralia has made historic progress in producing a variety of Blue Cheeses. The cheesemakers of Australia have been making blue-veined cheese for over 70 years. The first blue cheese factories were recorded to have started in northern New South Wales and Gippsland in the 1930s and 1940s.
