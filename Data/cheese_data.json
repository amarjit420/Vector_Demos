        "description": "Gouda, or \"How-da\" as the locals say, is a Dutch cheese named after the city of Gouda in the Netherlands. If truth be told, it\u00a0is one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption. It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. The original cheese market in Gouda is one of the last standing commercial cheese markets in the Netherlands. Since the name is not protected, it has become a generic classification for all cheeses produced and sold under the name Gouda.\nGouda is typically made from pasteurised cow\u2019s milk although some artisan varieties use sheep\u2019s or goat\u2019s milk to produce it. Boerenkaas is a typical variety of unpasteurised Gouda cheese produced by the farmers from the milk of cows grazing on the natural, low pastures of the Netherlands. There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within a few weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra-aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. The waxed rind of the cheese also changes by age as soft, younger Dutch Gouda cheese is identified by yellow, orange, or red wax rinds white mature cheese has black wax coverings.\nIn America, smoother and less flavourful commercial Gouda is more popular than Dutch Gouda. Artisans in the Netherlands may produce Dutch Gouda using raw milk as well as pasteurised milk.\u00a0 To enhance the flavour of the cheese, herbs, seasonings, and nuts are added. In the Netherlands, aged Gouda is commonly used to in soups and sauces.\nYoung Gouda is best paired with beer while medium-aged Gouda tastes best when paired with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. A well-aged Gouda complements wines that are deeply flavoured such as a rich Merlot or Shiraz. Gouda cheese may be grated, sliced, cubed or melted. It may be used as a table cheese or dessert cheese.",

        "name": "Brie",
        "description": "Brie is the best known French cheese and has the nickname \"The Queen of Cheese\". Brie is a soft cheese named after the French region Brie, where it was originally created. Several hundred years ago, Brie was one of the tributes which had to be paid to the French kings.\nIn France, Brie is very different from the cheese exported to the United States. Real French Brie is unstabilized and the flavour is complex when the surface turns slightly brown. When the cheese is still pure-white, it is not matured. If the cheese is cut before the maturing process, it will never develop properly. Exported Brie, however, is stabilized and never matures. Stabilized Brie has a much longer shelf life and is not susceptible to bacteriological infections.\nBrie is produced from the whole or semi-skimmed cow's milk. Rennet is added to the raw milk and heated to a temperature of 37\u00b0C (99\u00b0F) to obtain the curd.\u00a0 The cheese is then cast into moulds, several layers of cheese are filled into the mould and then kept for around 18 hours. After this, the cheese is salted and aged for a minimum of four weeks.\nBrie cheese is slightly pale in colour with a greyish tinge under a rind. Its flavour varies depending upon the ingredients added while producing the cheese.\nBrie, one of the great dessert cheeses, comes as either a 1 or 2-kilogram wheel and is packed in a wooden box. In order to enjoy the taste fully, Brie must be served at room temperature.\nPlease note:\u00a0Pasteurized milk is required in the United States and Australia.",

As per legislation, production of Pecorino Romano is allowed only on the islands of Sardinia, Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto.\nThe other pecorino cheeses are Pecorino Sardo (from Sardinia), Pecorino Toscano (from Tuscany), Pecorino Siciliano (from Sicily), Pecorino di Filiano (from Basilicata) and Pecorino Crotonese (from Province of Crotone in Calabria).\nAs the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella, have mentioned cheese & its production techniques. Even today, cheese is made using the traditional method. During the ageing process, the wheels get salted numerous times by hand. After ageing for more than five months, \u00a0it develops a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with a sweet and aromatic flavour. The flavour becomes sharper and smokier when aged for more than eight months.\nPecorino Romano is one of the most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheese.

Nowadays, many stores sell goat's and cow's milk feta as well. The firmness, texture and flavour of the cheese differ from region to region. Still, in general, cheese from Macedonia and Thrace is mild, softer and creamier, less salty with fewer holes. Feta made in Thessaly and Central Greece has a more intense, robust flavour. Peloponnese feta is dryer in texture, fully flavoured and more open. Local environment, animal breeds, and cultures have an impact on the texture, flavour and aroma of the cheese.\nOn the whole, feta is a pickled curd cheese that has a salty and tangy taste enhanced by the brine solution. The texture depends on the age, which can be extremely creamy or crumbly dry. Upon maturation of 2 months, feta is sold in blocks submerged in the brine. The cheese can be used as a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts.

These veins are created during production when cheese is 'spiked' with stainless steel rods to let oxygen circulate and encourage the growth of the mould. This process also softens the texture and develops a distinctive blue flavour.\nThe origin of Blue cheese has an interesting story. It is thought to have been invented by accident when a drunken cheesemaker left behind a half-eaten loaf of bread in moist cheese caves. When he returned, he discovered that the mould covering the bread had transformed it into blue cheese.\nBlue cheese is also identified by a peculiar smell that comes from cultivated bacteria. The flavour of the cheese depends on the type of blue cheese, shape, size, the climate of the curing and ageing period. But it generally tends to be sharp and salty. Some of the famous blue cheeses around the world are Roquefort from France, Gorgonzola from Italy and Stilton from England.\nBlue cheese tastes best when served with crackers, pears, raisins, fruit bread and walnuts.

        "name": "Limburger",
        "description": "Limburger is a semi-soft, washed-rind cheese that originated in the historical Duchy of Limburg, now divided into three countries; Germany, Belgium and Netherlands. The cheese is popularly known for its stinky aroma, which has been compared to foot odour. Today, most of the cheese is exclusively made in Germany, making them the sole producer in Europe.\nArtisanal cheese makers prepare this cheese from pasteurised cow\u2019s milk sourced from local, organic farms. As a result, the flavour of the cheese is mild despite the stinky aroma.\nThe exterior of the cheese is covered with a thin pale, orange-brown rind, an effect of regular washings.\nIn the first month, Limburger is firm and crumbly and becomes chalky and soft at the end of six weeks. After two months, the cheese is much smoother and creamy. After three months, Limburger acquires the infamous aroma due to smear-ripening bacterium.\u00a0This cheese has a significant grassy and mushroomy taste underlined by a delicate tang at the end.\nLimburger goes well with Belgian style ales and icy cold bock beer. It tastes best when it is served between two slices of dark rye bread and a slice of onion.",

        "name": "Comte",
        "description": "Comt\u00e9 is a French cheese produced in the Jura Massif region of Eastern France. The unpasteurised cow's milk used is mainly from Montbeliarde Cattle or French Simmental (or crossbreeds of the two). This hard mountain cheese is matured to perfection in the special caves where the cheese gets its unique taste, texture and colour. There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comt\u00e9 is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. A few times, Comt\u00e9 gets its name from the cellar where it has ripened, such as Comt\u00e9 Fort Saint-Antoine.\nComt\u00e9 was one of the first few kinds of cheese to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France, with around 40,000 tonnes of annual production.\nA wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline. There are over 80 flavours which can be savoured while tasting Comt\u00e9. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish.\nIts ability to melt easily means Comt\u00e9 goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain.",

        "description": "Cottage cheese is a cheese curd product with a mild flavour. The curd is drained but not pressed, so some whey remains and retains moisture. The curd is generally washed to remove the acidity. It is made from different types of milk with different fat levels.\nThe term 'cottage cheese' is believed to have originated because the cheese was generally made in cottages from leftover milk. Cottage cheese can be eaten by itself, with fruits, toast or even used in salads. The cheese is creamy, lumpy and sold in pots.",

        "description": "Double Gloucester is a traditional, full fat, hard cheese made from pasteurised or unpasteurised cow's milk. The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.\nGloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milking or a mixture of milk and cream. The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.\nDouble Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester.\nDouble Gloucester A has won many international awards including Silver medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards.",

        "name": "Red Leicester",
        "description": "Red Leicester, formerly known as Leicester or Leicestershire cheese is a traditional hard English cheese made from unpasteurised cow\u2019s milk. The history of cheese dates back to the 17th\u00a0century when farmers recognized the need to make and look at their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto.\u00a0The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a couple of farms in Leicestershire make the cheese using the traditional method and raw milk.\nRed Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to cheddar but much moister, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach its optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray.",

In the US, cream cheese contains at least 33% fat content, while in Britain, it should be a minimum of 45-65%. Anything above is considered double or triple cream cheese. In German, it is also called Doppelrhamstufel, meaning cheese made with \"double cream\". The cheese has a mild lactic aroma, a slightly salty and sweet taste. The cheese is suitable for vegetarians and comes in various flavoured varieties, including herbs, garlic, black pepper, fruits etc.\u00a0\nIt has a relatively short life, even when refrigerated. Cream cheese made using the traditional method tends to be more crumbly than spreadable, while those with stabilizers like guar gum are more firm. The taste, texture and production of cream cheese are similar to Boursin and Mascarpone.\nIt is used to enrich cheesecakes, frostings, dips, toppings, sweet & savoury dishes and desserts.",
